                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <img class="float-right" width="440px" src="congress.jpg">
                <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society, transparency
                    is government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how citizens
                    hold their public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government should be
                    transparent.</p>
                <p>Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business and
                    spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows good
                    and just governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens
                    about what their Government is doing.</p>
                <p>We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the Government's
                    effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society,
                    and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use
                    our site to become actively engaged in American government.</p>
                <p>TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We solicit
                    public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

                    <h4>Background History of Government Transparency</h4>
                </button>
                <div id="demo" class="collapse">
                    <p>In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to public
                        opinion dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an
                        attack on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The
                        passage of formal legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with
                        Sweden, for example, (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free
                        press legislation as part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach,
                        and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on the
                        eighteenth-century public sphere.</p>
                    <p>Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789), freedom
                        of the press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom
                        of the press in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean
                        statesmen to row back on these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal
                        politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.</p>
                    <p>Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and is
                        often linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim
                        to have adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern
                        provisions to the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after
                        gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951
                        (superseded by new legislation in 1999).</p>
                    <p>The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to
                        Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.</p>
